This repository demonstrates an uncommon but significant Dockerfile error: using the `ubuntu:latest` image. This is problematic because:

1. **Large Image Size:** `ubuntu:latest` is a large image, leading to slower builds and larger deployed images.
2. **Unpredictability:** The `latest` tag is always subject to change.  An update to the base image can break existing applications built on it.

The provided Dockerfile illustrates the problem. The `Dockerfile_fixed` file presents a more robust solution by using a specific version of the ubuntu image, eliminating the risk of unexpected updates. Always use specific tags or sha256 sums to build reproducible images.
